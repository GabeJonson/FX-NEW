				<h2 class="h2">HOW IT WORKS:</h2>
				<p>You attract clients to FX Manager website using your partnership link that is located at Partnership page in your FX Manager client area.
					<br><br>
				Let's assume that you recommended Alex to make money with FX Manager and he visited the FX Manager website or entered your partnership ID during the registration, and created a €10,000 Trial package with 60 trading days term.
					<br><br>
				Right after Alex created the package, 5% partnership commission equal to €500 is instantly accrued to your Current Account (1st level).
					<br><br>
				Let's assume that Alex recommended Daniel to make money with FX Manager. Daniel, using the Alex's partnership link, created a €10,000 package too. In this case, you will instantly receive 2% partnership commission equal to €500 for the package that was created by Daniel (2nd level).</p>

			<p class="partnership_s3__p">The commission is paid constantly for all referred clients at 1st and 2nd levels and for all packages ever created by them.
			<br><br>
			The partnership commission is paid instantly. It can be withdrawn or reinvested at any time.
			<br><br>
			It is not necessary to create any packages when you take part in FX Manager partnership program. You can simply make money by telling other people about the unique money-making opportunity with FX Manager.
			<br><br>
			Once someone registers an account with FX Manager using your partnership link, that person becomes your downline partner automatically.
			<br><br>
